                "I created a DailyWorks module where we enter the tasks we completed daily at the end of each day.",
                "I developed a module that allows searching for products in the factory based on the product number, entering the desired quantity along with the percentage of loss for that material, listing the sub-materials of that product, displaying the quantity of each sub-material in the inventory, determining the required quantity of each sub-material for the entered quantity, and updating the inventory accordingly. After listing these details in a table, the module automatically selects the missing sub-materials, displays them on a screen, and allows us to choose suppliers for these missing materials. In this supplier selection screen, we can see the suppliers of the missing materials, their costs for each sub-material, and the earliest delivery date. Upon selecting a supplier, the module generates the relevant order and automatically sends an email to the chosen supplier for the order, including details such as the quantity needed, cost, and earliest delivery date."
